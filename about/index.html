                    <h2>David Poon</h2>
                    <p>A consummate church musician, David Poon is sought after as an organist, choirmaster, continuo player, and accompanist. Although his education involved interpreting notes written by dead Europeans (he now specialises in performing
                        works by 16th-century English and 20th-century French composers), he often indulges in realising baroque bass lines, improvising over jazz standards, and extemporising on Gregorian chants.<br> David is currently assistant organist
                        at St. John's Vancouver Anglican Church. Before COVID, he was pianist for Choralations and Pender Harbour Community Choir; and music director for Coast Messiah Choir, MOTET chamber choir, and Vespersong. Outside of teaching, performing,
                        arranging, and composing, his interests include owning too many board games, judging Magic tournaments, and inflicting modes of limited transposition upon his wife and four children.</p>
